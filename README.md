# Cruze 8
A unique hybrid open world racing game

**Notice**: Cruze 8 is very early in development, and is not currently functional or playable. The information in this document is simply here to explain the concept of the game.

## Description

Cruze 8 is the continuation of Cruze 6 and the (un-released) Cruze 7. Instead of trying to be a completely unguided game, Cruze 8 is designed to give players more of a goal than previous Cruze version, without losing the open world feeling of the game. Previous versions of Cruze were just that, a game where you cruise around in various cars. However, this lead to the games feeling incomplete and under-developed even after thousands of hours of development. That's why Cruze 8 is designed around a more concrete goal for players.

In Cruze 8, you are placed within a city in a given location, and required to get to a finishing point as fast as possible. However, unlike traditional racing games, you aren't given a specific path to take. You're free to take any path you want to the finish. This means that you will not only have to drive well, but also be able to think quickly and find the most efficient path to your destination.


## Features

### Completely Open Source

Cruze 8 is completely freely licensed and open source from the ground up, meaning you're free to inspect the code, modify it, and share it!

### Light Weight

Cruze 8 is written in Godot, which is a signficantly lighter game engine than more common alternatives like Unity. This means Cruze 8 can be run on lower end hardware without issue!

### Engaging Physics

In most driving games, the cars feel connected to the ground, as if they are on rails. While Cruze 8 is not a driving simulator, attention has been put into making the driving physics feel engaging and realistic, while still being arcade-like and fun.
